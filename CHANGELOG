# RcmdrPlugin.MPAStats Changelog

## 1.0.2 -- February 1, 2013

* Updated: Minor changes to conform to updates in Rcmdr 1.9-4
	* Changed "Models" to "RcmdrModels" in DESCRIPTION
	* Removed old calls to `assign(..., envir=.GlobalEnv)`

## 1.0.1 -- July 10, 2012

* Added declaration of global variables for R 2.15.1, which removes all the warning messages that show up in the check process

## 1.0 -- June 14, 2012

* Released for initial CRAN submission
* Renamed RcmdrPlugin.MPAStats (formerly RcmdrPlugin.BYUMPA)
* Added: Menu for viewing the structure of the current dataframe (MPA Statistics -> Descriptive statistics -> View data set structure)
* Fixed: All documentation is correct. Package passes all `R CMD check` tests, with the exception of trivial "no visible binding for global variable" notes that occur in all Rcmdr plugins (and in the core Rcmdr)


## 0.5 -- June 7, 2012

* Added: The dialog for ordinal logistic regression now uses the `ordinal` library instead of the `MASS` library, since `ordinal` reports p-values in the summary table for the model.
* Added: The "Factor change coefficients" function in the Models menu calculates `e^b` for coefficients in logistic models.
* Fixed: Models created with `ordinal`'s `clm()` function now register in R Commander's model list, allowing users to use functions in the Models menu on objects of class `sclm`
* Removed: Ordinal logistic regression menus based on the `MASS` library.


## 0.1-0.2.1 -- May 2012

* Various alpha releases
